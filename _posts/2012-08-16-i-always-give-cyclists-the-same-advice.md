There's a new law in PA to increase the safety of biking in cities. Cars can now cross the double yellow when passing bicycles and should always leave a 4 foot cushion between them and bicycles.

>The differential in speed is the biggest safety challenge with motor vehicles and bicycles sharing our state's roadways

I've been a bike messenger, a commuter, and a general two wheeled fool in several cities for the last decade, and when people ask me for advice when biking in the city, I always give the same advice: *Ride Faster*.
